Only one member per group hands in and marks the other member. **Note**: you cannot change group members after the first hand-in, so make sure you do it correct the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report may be brief (try to keep it under 5 pages) but it is important that you fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The report must have a title page including names and user names (@cs) for all group members, course name, and assignment name.\n",
    " * The report should be as short as possible and as long as necessary. If your report exceeds five pages (incl. the title page), chances are that you are doing something wrong.\n",
    " * Describe how your solution works on a level that does not lose interesting details. Divide the report into two parts (one for $k$-NN, the other for the neural network), and split each part into *implementation*, *results*, and *discussion* subsections.\n",
    "   - Most important is that you describe how your solution works, and why you solved it in a particular way. Clearly state the ranges for your hyper-parameters, and explain why you chose those.\n",
    "   - Explain, and give pseudo-code for your hyper-parameter search. Explain any decisions/choices you've made.\n",
    "   - For the neural network: Plot how the loss evolve during training of your best model, and interpret the plot. The loss is available in the `MLPClassifier` after training.\n",
    "   - Describe how your work went and which problems and issues you faced when developing the program.\n",
    "   - Describe how you divided the work between you.\n",
    "   - Use clear, well written English language.\n",
    "   - You must not include your source code in the report, supply it in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "   - **Report your validation scores in the report.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code should align to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Comment the code in a reasonable way. Follow the [Docstring conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).\n",
    " * Structure your code in a suitable way, such that it is easy to follow what is going on.\n",
    " * Name classes, variables, methods, modules, *etc.*, such that the names clearly describe their function and follow the specifications given above.\n",
    " * The code you hand in should not contain sections that are not used, or unnecessary. Make sure that you understand every part of the code that you hand in.\n",
    " * **Important:** hand in a notebook that contains your execution results, i.e., execute the notebook from scratch (**Kernel** - **Re-start and run all**) and save before you hand in."
